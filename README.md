# waterpump
This repository contains a Python notebook & HTML output files that were created for a competition hosted by DrivenData.org. The "Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table" challenge asked entrants to use data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to predict water pump failure based on variables such as location, water quality, and so on.
